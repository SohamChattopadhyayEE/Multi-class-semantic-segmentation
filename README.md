# Multi-class Semantic Segmentation
This is a python-based project performing multi-class semantic segmentation task with classical UNet and different versions of it. The key idea behind the word **semantic segmentation** is recognizing and understanding contents of an image at pixel level. Semantic segmentation has versatile applications in various fields, starting from bio-medical engineering to autonomous vehicle, this has become very effective. More about semantic segmentation can be found [here](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/semantic-segmentation/). Here in this project the segmentation framework is evaluated on a large scale scene segmentation dataset named Mapillary Dataset.
